# Setup

Install the latest Playdate API from https://play.date/dev/
Install the gcc arm eabi toolkit from https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

Copy (not cut!) all files from `fake-08/platform/playdate/C_API_EDIT` to the `C_API` folder of your Playdate SDK.


If you are planning on doing other Playdate development, it might be a smart idea to set up a separate unmodified SDK install.

Now, all you should have to do is run `make` in `fake-08/platform/playdate`!

(probably.)
