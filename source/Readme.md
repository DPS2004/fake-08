This is an emulator for Pico 8 games for Nintendo homebrew platforms.

Still in early development, not recommended for others use.

As of now, it should build and run on 3ds, but most carts will crash because the API isn't built out

Initial goal is playability of as many non-tweet cart games as possible

Latter goals include sound support and memory compatibility

Basic Roadmap:
-finish basic graphics api support
(x) implement overloads of existing graphics API
(x) Add camera() support
(x) Add clip() support
( ) Add map(), mget(), mset() support
( ) Add pal() support
( ) Add palt() support


Add support for other non-lua pico functions

Add 30 and 60 fps support

make flip() work for carts without update

add switch, and possibly wii u support



music() and sfx() support
fillp() support
peek() and poke() initial support
