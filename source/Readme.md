This is an emulator for Pico 8 games for Nintendo homebrew platforms.

Still in early development, not recommended for others use.

As of now, it should build and run on 3ds, but most carts will crash because the API isn't built out

Initial goal is playability of as many non-tweet cart games as possible

Latter goals include sound support and memory compatibility

Basic Roadmap:
-finish basic graphics api support
implement overloads of existing graphics API
Add clip() support
Add camera() support
Add map(), mget(), mset() support
Add pal() support
Add palt() support


Add support for other non-lua pico functions

Add 30 and 60 fps support



music() and sfx() support
fillp() support
peek() and poke() initial support
